        <h3>General Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Daniel Torres. I'm currently a student at Illinois Tech, majoring in Information Technology and Management (ITM) with a minor in Software Engineering. My journey into web development started in January 2021, and since then, I've gained experience in various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and backend technologies like APIs through React Redux and Firebase.</p>
        <p>I've hosted websites on Debian and Ubuntu servers using NGINX and Apache. Through this class, I'm excited to gain more formal experience in web development and specialize in it as part of my career in IT.</p>

        <h3>What I'm looking forward too in this class</h3>
        <p>Overall looking for more in-depth experience in web development. Front end design, responsive layouts, and cool "party tricks", are things I wish to improve on and think will be useful skills to have as a web developer.</p>
